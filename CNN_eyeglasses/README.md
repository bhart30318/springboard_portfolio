# Detecting Eyeglasses in Twitter profile pictures
In this project, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) in TensorFlow on the CelebFaces Attribute Dataset (CelebA) to recognize whether or not a person is wearing glasses in an image. I then apply my CNN to Twitter profile pictures to determine whether or not that Twitter user is wearing eyeglasses.

The model obtains excellent performance in training/testing phase with CelebA, and good performance on social media images (~85% accuracy). 

Code and plots for data wrangling and preparation can be found in the 'data' folder and modeling code and plots can found in the 'modeling' folder. A final report and presentation can be found in the 'final' folder.
