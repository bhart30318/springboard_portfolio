# Springboard Portfolio
Portfolio repository for work done in Springboard's Data Science Career Track. 

My first capstone project involved predicting electricity demand in LA using weather data and machine learning techniques and those materials can be found in the 'Electricity_Demand' folder. 

My second capstone project involved training a convolutional neural network on a dataset of celebrity images to identify whether the celebrity in the image is wearing eyeglasses. The model was then used to identify whether social media users are wearing eyeglasses or not and achieved high accuracy. The materials for the second capstone can be found in the 'CNN_eyeglasses' folder.

The 'mini_projects' folder contains IPython notebooks and code for different mini project I completed throughout the course.
