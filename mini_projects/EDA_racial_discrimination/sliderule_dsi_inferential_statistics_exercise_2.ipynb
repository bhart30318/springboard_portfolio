    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "#### Q4: In both the boostrapping and frequentist analysis, we see strong evidence that we should reject our null hypothesis: that there is no difference between the mean number of callbacks between white-sounding and black-sounding names. With the bootstrapping analysis, after 100,000 simulations, none of simulated mean differences had a value as extreme as was observed, and with the frequentist analysis, we found a very small p-value of ~4x10^-5, both indicating that the null hypothesis is extremely unlikely and should be rejected."

    "#### Q5: This analysis does not imply that race is THE MOST important factor in callback success--rather that race, or at least white-sounding vs black-sounding names, is one significant factor in callback success, and that the results show that it is very unlikely that there is no difference between the mean number of callbacks between white-sounding and black-sounding names. For one, we have yet to examine all the other factors that could contribute to callback success and assess their significance, so we don't know whether it's THE MOST important. One could potentially amend their analysis by sending resumes with the same names but different background to assess the significance of that factor. On the other hand, perhaps there are geographic factors based on where resumes are sent that could skew results. Either way, this analysis shows race is a significant factor, but as for THE MOST important, more tests could be done."
